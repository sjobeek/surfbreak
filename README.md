# Surfbreak
A toolkit for the physical analysis and modeling of surf breaks from video.

See [the following index notebook](nbs/index.ipynb) for an overview. 

The DNN model used to learn the spatio-temporal waveform function is based on the SIREN paper [Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09661).

## nbdev test format
This repo is experimenting with [nbdev v1](https://nbdev1.fast.ai/) to document, execute, and visualize the results of tests. The test notebooks can be found in the `nbs` folder.
